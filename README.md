# Plant Push


## Installation
The game is built with tic80
https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/


I reccomend you download and install tic80 for your platform (make sure it's on your $PATH)
Then just clone this repo and run this command to run the game.
```
tic80 --fs . --cmd 'load game.tic & import code game.lua & run' --keepcmd --skip
```

## How it started

Back in 2020 I started.
This project began when I saw [this](https://tic80.com/play?cart=1229) cart on tic80 and thought it would be cool to use the mouse to control the camera.
From there I expanded the project adding smaller features one by one until it started to look more and more like a real game.
